#2. The headlights of a car should only automatically turn on when the daylight outside is below a certain threshold. If a sensor threshold is below the number 8, print "Headlights On"; otherwise, print "Headlights Off".
sensor = 6

if sensor < 8:
    print("Headlights on")
    
else: 
    print("Headlights off")
